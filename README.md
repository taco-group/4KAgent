## Introduction

We present **4KAgent**, an agentic image super-resolution generalist designed to universally upscale any image to **4K resolution**, regardless of input type, degradation level, or domain. **4KAgent** offers these key features:

- ðŸ”¥ **Framework**: **4KAgent** is the first AI agent framework for universal any-image-to-4K upscaling, capable of handling **all image categories**, ranging from classical and realistic degradations, extreme low-quality inputs, AI-generated imagery, to scientific imaging tasks such as remote sensing, microscopy, and biomedical inputs.

- ðŸ”¥ **System Design**: A multi-agent system in **4KAgent**, the **Perception Agent** employs large vision-language models (VLMs) to analyze the content and distortion in the image and provide the restoration plan for the restoration agent to execute. The **Restoration Agent**, which sets up an executionâ€”reflectionâ€”rollback procedure for recursive restoration and upscaling.

- ðŸ”¥ **Q-MoE & Face Restoration pipeline**: In each restoration step of the restoration plan, we propose a Quality-Driven Mixture-of-Expert (**Q-MoE**) policy in execution and reflection to select the optimal image. We further develop a **face restoration pipeline** to enhance faces in images.

- ðŸ”¥ **Profile Module**: To expand the applicability of **4KAgent**, we propose a **Profile Module** to bring the availability to customize the system for different restoration tasks. **4KAgent** can adapt to different restoration tasks without extra training.

- ðŸ”¥ **DIV4K-50 Dataset**: We build the **DIV4K-50** dataset as a challenging testset to upscale a low-quality (LQ) image in 256 Ã— 256 resolution with multiple degradations to a high-quality (HQ) 4K image in 4096 Ã— 4096 resolution.
